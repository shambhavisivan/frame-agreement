## T-54321: Enable Bulk Negotiation for legacy pricing.

Products that are modelled using the 'legacy pricing' approach can now be negotiated in bulk. The user navigates to the 'Negotiation' screen, selects 1-n charges to which a discount should be applied, sets the discount and clicks "Apply Discount".
