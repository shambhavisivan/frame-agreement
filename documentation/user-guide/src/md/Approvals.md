# Approvals

Framework Agreement Management can be used to handle both out of the box and standard approval processes. Approval History can be seen above the product negotiation section of the Frame Agreement console:

If the user is designated as approver, he will be able to approve, reject or recall the approval process. Frame Agreement will reload history after any major action, but manual refresh is also possible in case custom approvals are used. 

## Out of the box approval process
During negotiation time, any charge or rate that is negotiated will be evaluated against the associated Discount Threshold. Once Frame Agreement is saved with any values breaching Discount Threshold, the Frame Agreement status will be set to Requires Approval state defined in custom settings. An example of negotiating Add Ons with indication for required approval can be seen here:

The approval process name needs to be set in Custom Settings.
