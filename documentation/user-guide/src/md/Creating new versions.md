# Creating new versions

Once Frame Agreement is activated, a new version can be created. In order to do that, click the Create New Version button:

This will clone the original Frame Agreement and set it as Draft. After that, it is possible to amend it and go through the whole negotiation process again. After the changed Frame Agreement is activated, the replaced Frame Agreement will be marked as Closed Replaced.

>**Note**: \
>- Draft, Activated and Closed Replaced statuses need to be defined in FAC Custom Settings.
>- Make sure that when there are multiple versions only one version remains in active sate
